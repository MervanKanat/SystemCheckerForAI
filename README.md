# System Compatibility Checker

This Python script utilizes the `wmi`  library to check the system's hardware compatibility with AI libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch. It identifies the CPU and GPU specifications and determines support for AVX instructions and CUDA-compatible NVIDIA GPUs, displaying the results in a formatted table in the terminal.

## Usage

Run the script in a Windows environment where Python and the necessary libraries (`wmi` and `rich`) are installed. Ensure to activate a Python virtual environment if applicable.
